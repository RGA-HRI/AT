<h3> Research Projects: </h3>


<li>

Partial Differential Equation:


	<ul>
Brief Intro.: A partial differential equation (PDE) is a type of differential equation that involves an unknown function of multiple variables and its partial derivatives. PDEs are widely used to model and analyze various physical phenomena and processes in fields such as physics, engineering, finance, and biology. They provide a mathematical framework for describing dynamic systems involving multiple variables and their ineractions.
The classification and properties of PDEs depend on various factors, such as their order, linearity, and the nature of the function being solved. Some common types of PDEs include the heat equation, wave equation, Laplace's equation, and the Schroedinger equation. Each of these equations captures specific behaviors and characteristics of the systems they represent.
	</ul>

		<ul>
Prerequisites: Real and Complex analysis, Measure theory, Functional Analysis, Ordinary differential equation
	</ul>
	
		<ul>
	Topics to be covered: Characteristics method for first order PDE, Classification of 2nd order PDEs, fundamental solutions and Green functions for Laplace, heat and wave equations, explicit solution formulas, harmonic functions, mean value property, maximum principles, uniqueness of solutions, method of separation of variables, similarity methods, transform methods, power series method, Cauchy-Kowalewsky theorem, Holmgren's uniqueness theorem.

Introduction to the Mathematical Fluid Mechanics

	<ul>

Brief Intro.: Mathematical fluid mechanics deals with the study of fluid flow using mathematical models and techniques. It provides a theoretical framework to understand and analyze the behavior of fluids, such as liquids and gases, in various physical systems. This involves PDEs (for example Navier-Stokes equation) which are usually derived from the principles of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy.
This course is designed to give an overview of fluid dynamics from a mathematical viewpoint, and to introduce students to areas of active research in fluid dynamics.
</ul>
	<ul>
Prerequisites: Real and Complex Analysis, Measure theory, Functional Analysis, Partial Differential Equation.
</ul>
	<ul>
Topics to be covered: Derivation of the governing equations: Navier-Stokes, Euler and some of its properties, Vorticity formulation, Low reynolds number flows, Stokes flow, Lubrication theory, Stokes Paradox, Boundary layers and asymptotic models, (non)-existence of solutions, Water waves, Instability analysis etc.
Depending on the specific interest, some of the advanced topics one may choose are the following: Theory of semigroup and its application in PDE, PDEs as gradient flows, Fluid-structure Interaction problem, Thin film flows, Models arising in geophysical fluid dynamics.

Homogenization
</ul>
	<ul>

Brief Intro.: Homogenization is a mathematical technique used to study the behavior of complex heterogeneous materials or structures in order to understand the effective or macroscopic behavior of a material or structure that consists of multiple microscopic components with different properties. It aims to derive mathematical models that capture the averaged or macroscopic behavior of such systems. This procedure typically involves two steps: the microscale analysis and teh macroscale analysis.
</ul>
	<ul>
Prerequisites: Real and Complex Analysis, Measure theory, Functional Analysis, Partial Differential equation.
</ul>
	<ul>
Topics to be covered:   In this course, we will learn about the microscale and the macroscale analysis from various point of view.
In the microscale analysis, the behavior of the individual microscopic components is analyzed using techniques such as asymptotic analysis, variational methods, or multiscale expansions. This step provides information about how the individual components interact with each other and with their surroundings. In the macroscale analysis, the informtaion obtained from the microscale analysis is used to derive effective equations that describe the behavior of the entire system on a larger scale.

Inverse Problem

	<ul>
Brief Introduction: Mathematical inverse problems refer to a class of problems where the goal is to determine the unknown causes or parameters of a system based on observed data or measurements. In other words, given the output or response of a system, inverse problems aim to reconstruct the input or the cause that generated the observed data.
The forward model describes how the system behaves and generated the output based on the input. the inverse model uses the information provided by the forward model and the observed data to estimate or infer the unknown quantities. Applications of inverse problems are widespreas. They include image reconstruction in medical imaging (e.g., computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging), seismic imaging in geophysics, remote sensing, and many more. Inverse problems play a vital role in extracting valuable information from observed data and improving our understanding of complex systems.

Prerequisites: Real and Complex Analysis, measure theory, Functional Analysis, Partial Differential equation.
